Workshop code for SADI workshop: sonic interaction and experience, July 31 - August 4, 2017

Workshop Description:
Shawn Greenlee (Associate Professor, RISD) will lead a workshop on designing sound-based interactions and experiences with the programming language Pure Data (Pd).  Shawn will provide an introduction to Pure Data, an open source programming language.  The workshop focus will be on the development of a project for mobile devices, incorporating on-screen interaction and data from onboard sensors. Topics covered will include sound synthesis and sampling, audio signal processing, and auditory display.

**For today's session:**

1. You'll need a computer (lab machine or laptop), a mobile device (iOS or Android), a USB sync cable, headphones, and a sketchbook.
2. If working on your laptop, download and install Pd 0.47-1 (Pure Data) from <a href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html" target="_blank">http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html</a>.  Put it in your Applications folder (i.e. get it out of your Downloads folder).  Make sure not to download the "test release" or 64-bit version.
3. Download MobMuPlat development package: <a href="http://danieliglesia.com/mobmuplat/" target="_blank">http://danieliglesia.com/mobmuplat/</a>. Make a new working folder on your Desktop and move the MobMuPlat package there (get it out of your Downloads folder)
4. For your mobile device, download MobMuPlat either from <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/kr/app/mobmuplat/id597679399?mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes store (iOS)</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iglesiaintermedia.mobmuplat" target="_blank">Google Play store (Android)</a>.  It's a free app.
5. For iOS, you'll need iTunes.  For Mac + Android, you can use Android file transfer:  <a href="https://www.android.com/filetransfer/" target="_blank">https://www.android.com/filetransfer/</a>  
6. You'll need the appropriate sync cable for your device.  Alternatively you can transfer files via AirDrop (iOS), e-mail, or file-sharing apps.
7. If you have Windows + Android, file transfer should be fairly straightforward, we'll figure it out.
